Hi! My name is Aarthee Baskaran and I'm a second semester BINF master's student at Northeastern. 
I'm 25 years old and worked in Cambridge for about two years at the Broad Institute 
before coming for this program! I really enjoy pickleball, crocheting, watching tv/movies, and hanging out with friends!
I'm really excited to advance my career as a bioinformatician and hope to work in areas such as cancer genomics or therapeutics.
